This website serves as a way to track and visualize how ITN training and resources are utilized.

Specific resources are split among the following pages:
* Software (e.g., CRAN package downloads, GitHub template utilization, and Shiny App usage)
* Online courses (e.g., online book versions, Leanpub, and Coursera)
* In-person training (e.g., attendance and survey responses)
* Videos and podcast episodes
* Collaborations

This website utilizes the OTTR framework to run checks (spelling, URL, and preview) on PRs.
